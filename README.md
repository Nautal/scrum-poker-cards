# Planning Poker cards by Nautal
# Based on the idea of [Redbooth Planning Cards](https://github.com/redbooth/scrum-poker-cards)


As Nautal team growths, also does our metodologies and guess it! We've choosen [Scrum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_%28software_development%29)!

To make the sprint planning meeting a little bit more fun, we created our own planning poker cards.
The main idea is that each card represents the dificulty of a given task with a number. All of them based in the sea and nautical wold

Here is what each card means:

- 0 - You know, for a clownfish, he really isn't that funny
- 1/2 - Low cost boat
- 1 - Just enjoy
- 2 - Kayak solo, sleep tandem
- 3 - Fast'n'Furious
- 5 - Full Throttle, what can go wrong?
- 8 - Stop the engine and relax
- 13 - Once you try it...
- 20 - Yes! We are MYBA!
- 40 - Love boat
- 100 - Titanic can't sink

**Special** cards:
- Help! I need somebody... - Need people for this task
- Starbucks time - Let's have a break
- No idea we I am - Don't know enough about this task
- Tsunami coming! - Task that will generate a lot of issues
- Emergency - Could be a personal or a work emergency but the meeting has ended
